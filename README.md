This is an abandoned clone of the world's most popular video game: Tetris. I implemented the tetris board, pieces, different 
colors, row-deletion, and collision-perfect rotations before asking myself "Why am I doing this. I don't even like Tetris?!". 
Fork if ye dare.

`$ make.`
`$ ./Tetris`

## __Dependencies__  
* SDL2  
* Custom SDL wrapper library because I didn't know any better

## __Controls__  
* A-D to move left and right
* F to drop piece faster
* W to rotate piece

simply run make to build, or use the pre-built executable (./Tetris) built on x64 linux kernel 4.13.0


#The makefile as-is only works if you copy all of the subdir's contents into the root dir of this project

This project serves as a reminder of how naive we all once were, and how much we've grown.
